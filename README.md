# ML-Credit-Risk-Scoring-Model
This repository contains a loan/credit risk classification model that I created as a personal project. The model predicts the likelihood of loan default using machine learning, assisting in credit risk assessment.

The model is trained on the Lending Club loan dataset ([Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wordsforthewise/lending-club/data)) which contains over 100,000 observations with customer and loan information.

The project includes:
- Data Cleaning and Transformation
- Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization
- Feature Engineering (with adding unique Financial Credit Ratios/Features as new features)
- Machine Learning Modeling (Logistic Regression, Random Forests, XGBoost) with Cross Validation
- Results Intrepretation and Actionable Insights for Risk Management

# Purpose
I created this project to apply and expand my finance knowledge while gaining hands-on experience with machine learning. It demonstrates a practical application for credit risk scoring, providing insights into high-risk loans and strategies to mitigate financial risk.

# Requirements
Python 3.13.7

The project was developed on Windows 11, but it can run on any platform with the required Python version and libraries.

Additionally, you would need to have Jupyter Notebooks installed in order to run the file.
